<h2><a href="/blog?id=5635480947261440">9/11 was perpetrated by the CIA </a></h2>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released its long-awaited report on the collapse of World Trade 7 following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. &#34;Our take-home message today is that the reason for the collapse of World Trade Center 7 is no longer a mystery,&#34; NIST lead investigator Shyam Sunder told journalists at this morning&#39;s press conference in Gaithersburg, Md. &#34;WTC 7 collapsed because of fires fueled by office furnishings. It did not collapse from explosives or from diesel fuel fires.&#34;

Conspiracy theorists have long pointed to the collapse of the 47-story structure as key evidence that the U.S. government orchestrated or abetted the 9/11 attacks. No planes struck the building, and the commonly available views of the exterior didn&#39;t show significant damage. Yet, at 5:20 pm, 7 hours after the collapse of the Twin Towers (WTC 1 and 2), WTC 7 rapidly fell in on itself. Since WTC 7 housed Secret Service and CIA offices, conspiracy theorists claimed that the building was destroyed in a controlled demolition in order to obliterate evidence of the U.S. government&#39;s complicity in the terrorist attacks. &#34;It is impossible for a building to fall the way it fell without explosives being involved,&#34; stated actress and TV personality Rosie O&#39;Donnell of ABC&#39;s The View in March 2007. &#34;For the first time in history, steel was melted by fire. It is physically impossible,&#34; she said.

Today&#39;s report confirms that a fire was, indeed, the cause. &#34;This is the first time that we are aware of, that a building taller than about 15 stories has collapsed primarily due to fires,&#34; Sunder told reporters at the press conference. &#34;What we found was that uncontrolled building fires--similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings--caused an extraordinary event, the collapse of WTC7.&#34; The unprecedented nature of the event means that understanding the precise mechanism of the collapse is important not just to answer conspiracy theorists&#39; questions, but to improve safety standards in the engineering of large buildings.

The final report describes how debris from the collapse of WTC 1 ignited fires on at least 10 floors of WTC 7 at the western half of the south face. Fires on Floors 7 through 9 and 11 through 13 burned out of control, because the water supply to the automatic sprinkler system had failed. The primary and backup water supply to the sprinkler systems for the lower floors relied on the city&#39;s water supply. Those water lines were damaged by the collapse of WTC 1 and 2. These uncontrolled fires in WTC 7 eventually spread to the northeast part of the building, where the collapse began.</p>

<h2><a href="/blog?id=5697869507985408">Neurofibrillary tangle</a></h2>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterised clinically by memory loss, cognitive impairment and behavioural problems [1], and neuropathologically by neuronal and synaptic loss and by various deposits containing the amyloid-beta protein (Aβ) and aggregated microtubule-associated protein tau in the form of neurofibrillary pathologies including neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), dystrophic neurites in neuritic plaques (NP) and neuropil threads (NT) [2]. Assessments of these lesions form the basis for the neuropathological confirmation of a clinical diagnosis of probable AD according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) protocol [2, 3] and the assessment of tau-immunoreactive (IR) changes according to Braak stage [4, 5]. The assessments for neuropathologically diagnosing AD have been updated recently to include assessments of Aβ deposits [6, 7].

The tau-associated pathologies, visualised by various methods and assessed using both the CERAD protocol [2, 3] and Braak staging [5, 8], include NFT, NP and NT. NFT are intracellular fibrous inclusions composed of paired helical filaments (PHFs) of aggregated and often hyperphosphorylated tau [9]. The CERAD protocol [2, 3] counts only those neurons with mature, robustly staining NFT; those neurons with diffuse or granular staining are classified as pre-tangles and are not counted. The morphology of tau-IR cytoplasmic inclusions is not considered. The presence of extracellular ghost NFT, the remains of NFT after the neuron has died, are noted in both CERAD and Braak staging. These are assessed on haematoxylin and eosin (H &amp; E) or silver stained slides because many tau-IR epitopes associated with NFT are lost [10].

In addition to the well-recognised AD-associated pathologies and argyrophilic grains in argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) [11], various studies have demonstrated that the dense granules of granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) also react with tau antibodies directed against various epitopes [10, 12, 13, 14, 15] but not those directed against some conformational epitopes specific for PHFs [16, 17]. The possibility of potential confusion relating to the interpretation of tau-IR pathology has been noted previously [15]. GVD, first described by Teofil Simchowicz [18], is characterised by neurons with two or more double membrane-bound cytoplasmic vacuoles containing an electron-dense granule [19] and are usually assessed on H &amp; E slides. GVD is noted in the CERAD protocol as present or absent in the hippocampus [2, 3]. GVD is distinct from other tau-IR granules described previously that lack membrane enclosed vacuoles and have been interpreted as PHF core bodies [20].

GVD within hippocampal pyramidal cells has previously been associated with increasing age and AD [21, 22, 23] and is associated with intraneuronal accumulation of tau protein [21]. GVD is also found in other neurodegenerative disorders, including Pick’s disease, multiple system atrophy with Parkinsonism, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with dementia, Down syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy [15, 24, 25]. Previous work has suggested a possible progression of development for GVD [23, 26], ranging from a few cytoplasmic granulovacuolar inclusions to neurons completely filled with granulovacuolar inclusions, which may follow topographical stages [15, 27]. While the association of GVD with AD has long been noted [12, 21], a recent study estimating the contributions of rare or disregarded pathologies [28] found no significant association between GVD and dementia when plaques and tangles were controlled for—raising questions relating to the significance of GVD to dementia.

The literature reviewed suggests that the relationship between GVD and dementia is unclear and that there is potential for confusion in interpretations of tau-IR pathologies. We examined the pathology of tau-IR GVD and NFT in detail in the cornus ammonis (CA) fields of the hippocampus in the population-based Cambridge City over-75s Cohort (CC75C) with an antibody against the C-terminal portion of tau that is not dependent on phosphorylation or PHF-specific epitopes. We categorised neuronal tau pathology as NFT, GVD or mixed (NFT+GVD), and investigated how this detailed morphology relates to current assessments of GVD and tau pathology according to well-accepted protocols and relates to the associations between NFT, GVD and dementia.

Materials and methods

The study sample
CC75C is a population-based, longitudinal study of aging and dementia with a brain donation programme [29]. Each study participant gave consent to participate and for brain donation. Consent for brain donation was also given by next of kin. Each phase of the CC75C study has been approved by the Cambridge Research Ethics Committee.

At the time of this study a total of 237 brain donations had CERAD measures, of which 211 cases were included for all analyses. Twenty five slides were not available or the area of interest was not present on the slide to score tau-IR GVD, NFT and GVD+NFT. For one slide, CA1 was not evaluable owing to complete neuronal loss.

A consensus diagnosis for dementia status at death consistent with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria [30] was agreed by clinicians, blinded to neuropathology reports, using post-mortem review of all clinical information including proxy informant data, death certificates and retrospective informant data after death. Dementia severity was rated as none, minimal, mild, moderate and severe [31]. Where dementia severity could not be rated it was scored as unknown.

Neuropathological protocols
Brain collection for this study occurred between 1989 and 2009. After death, the brains were removed as soon as possible in the local mortuary. The brains were bisected in the sagittal plane. One cerebral hemisphere was dissected coronally into approximately 1 cm slices, macroscopically examined and then snap-frozen to –80 °C. The other half of the brain was fixed in formalin for at least 6 weeks and dissected coronally into approximately 1 cm slices. For diagnostic purposes, tissue blocks for paraffin embedding were taken from the hippocampus (at the level of the lateral geniculate body), entorhinal cortex (at the level of the mammillary body), frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes, basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, medulla, cerebellum and two levels of the midbrain. Serial sections from the paraffin-embedded brain tissue samples were assessed for neuropathology blind to clinical status according to the CERAD protocol [2, 3] and Braak stage [4, 5]. All slides were produced by the Cambridge Brain Bank, Cambridge, UK and assessments were performed blind to clinical status by neuropathologists at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, UK. All immunostained sections for diagnosis were counterstained with Ehrlich’s haematoxylin with diaminobenzidine as the chromagen.

Lewy bodies were assessed as present or absent using 10 μm sections stained with H &amp; E in combination with slides stained with anti-ubiquitin antibody (pAb BR 251, Z0458; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) (first 174 donations) or with anti-α-synuclein (SA3400; Biomol International, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, New York, USA) (last 63 cases). Aβ deposits as senile plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) were visualised with Congo red and/or anti-Aβ antibody (M872, Clone 6 F/3D; DAKO) on 10 μm sections and assessed as none, mild, moderate or severe according to the CERAD protocol [2].

Inclusions reactive with tar-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) were assessed using 9 μm sections from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex stained with anti-TDP-43 antibody (pS409/410-2; Cosmo Bio Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Slides were counterstained with Harris’ haematoxylin with diaminobenzidine as the chromagen. Solid neuronal inclusions were assessed, based on the protocol in Neumann et al. [32], as none (no inclusions), minimal (one inclusion per slide), mild (one or more inclusions in up to half the fields of view per slide), moderate (a few inclusions in over half the fields of view per slide) or severe (a few inclusions in most fields of view per slide).

Sections 10 μm thick from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex were immunostained with anti-tau monoclonal antibody (mAb) 11.57 (supplied by The Cambridge Brain Bank, dilution 1:5; gift donated by Professor Claude Wischik, University of Aberdeen, UK) to visualise NFT, NP and dystrophic neurites. mAb 11.57 was raised against a pronase-treated PHF core sub-fraction and recognises a phosphorylation and conformation-independent epitope in the C-terminal region of tau [12]. mAb 11.57 recognises NFT, NP, NT and GVD bodies and the grains of AGD but not ghost NFT [12, 33]. During the diagnostic process, an experienced neuropathologist scored the severity of NFT according to the CERAD protocol [2, 3] as either none, mild, moderate or severe. GVD, defined as neurons with two or more membrane-bound cytoplasmic vacuoles containing a basophilic granule, was rated according to the CERAD protocol [2, 3] as present or absent on hippocampal sections 10 μm thick stained with H &amp; E.

A second protocol was designed to assess the separate tau-IR pathologies based on morphology. Tau-IR NFT (defined as neurons with fibrous deposits of tau and no vacuoles containing an electron dense granule), tau-IR GVD (defined as neurons with two or more membrane-bound cytoplasmic vacuoles containing a tau-IR dense granule and no fibres) and neurons containing mixed pathology with both fibrous and granulovacuolar pathology (NFT+GVD) were scored at 100× magnification as none, an isolated example per area, and as mild, moderate or severe by comparison with the references images for NFT from the CERAD protocol [3]. The same slides were assessed with both protocols. Higher magnifications (200× and 400×) were used to assess the detailed morphology of any tau-IR structures that could not be classified at lower magnification (100×). Separate scores for the hippocampal regions CA1 and CA2–3, the regions most associated with tau immunoreactivity, were generated by SH and inter-rated by TP. Regions CA2 and CA3 were combined for scoring owing to difficulties in reliably defining the CA2–CA3 boundary. Photomicrographs were taken with a Leica DM LB microscope with a DC500 digital camera Wetzlar, Germany.

Inter-rater analysis
The extent of agreement between two raters (SH and TP) in relation to severity of NFT, GVD and NFT+GVD in CA1 and CA2–3 was assessed by calculating Gwet’s AC2 coefficients (Table 1). This is a paradox-resistant alternative to Kappa’s coefficient when the overall percentage agreement is high [34]. The coefficient calculations were performed using Agreestat 2011.2 (Advanced Analytics, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The extent of agreement was assessed using the benchmark proposed by Landis and Koch [35]; a coefficient &gt;0.6 indicates substantial agreement and a value &gt;0.8 near-perfect agreement. In general, NFT and GVD were seen to have AC2 coefficients &gt;0.6, implying substantial agreement, which was more marked in CA1 (Table 1). The only exception was for NFT+GVD in CA2–3 (AC2 = 0.13), where agreement was poor. This was most probably due to a combination of differences in assigning the CA1/CA2 boundary and the rarity of neurons with both tau-IR NFT and GVD pathologies. Data for NFT+GVD were not included in further analyses.

Statistical analysis
Inter-rater reliability was not substantial for NFT+GVD in CA2–3, so further analyses were restricted to NFT and GVD in the CA1 area only. The mean (standard deviation) is presented when applicable.

The relationships between tau-IR GVD and NFT with dementia status were verified using logistic regression. Dementia status was defined as the dependent variable and tau-IR scores in CA1 as independent variables. Three hierarchical models were created: model 1 controlled for sex and age at death; model 2 was additionally controlled for NFT and NP; and model 3 additionally controlled for TDP-43 and amyloid deposits. The same approach was used to verify the relationships between tau-IR GVD and NFT with dementia severity, using ordinal logistic regression.

The Spearman coefficient (r) was calculated to verify the relationships between different pathologies and different protocols. All tests were two-tailed. Statistical analyses were performed using statistical package STATA, version 12 College Station, Texas, USA.

Results

In total, 211 brains were included in the sample. Among them, 147 (70 %) were women. Mean age of death was 90.97 (4.51) years. Dementia status at death could not be determined in eight (4 %) participants, 71 (34 %) did not have dementia and 132 (63 %) had dementia at death.

Both NFT and GVD were common; using the new protocol, 91 % of the cases surveyed showed both GVD and NFT in the hippocampal CA1 fields, 1 % had NFT with no GVD, 4 % had GVD with no NFT and 4 % had neither NFT nor GVD pathology.

Relationship between CERAD assessments and the new protocol
Table 2 presents a comparison between CERAD protocol GVD scores (columns) and the morphologically separated tau-IR GVD scores from the modified protocol (rows). Assessments using H &amp; E slides underestimated GVD pathology: 95 % (54/57) of cases scored as having no GVD according to the CERAD protocol were scored as having at least mild GVD in CA1 according to the tau-IR stain.

<h2><a href="/blog?id=5668906396024832">this is very smart post about beer</a></h2>
<p>Smooth, thick and viscous on the palate, with a full and robust body. For a moment, it&#39;s sweet and tropical, then hops rush in and tear it all to shreds! The lip-smacking hop profile roams all over the place, as a sticky pine and a slightly burnt resinous coating forms on the palate. Intensely spicy, with a big grape-fruity zest and a sugary, warming alcohol that smacks you upside the head for noticing it. Malt-wise, caramel and bread flavors clamor to be heard, but the hops entangle them and draw them back into the depths of the brew, where they die. Malt flavors are there, but they add sweetness and body versus anything distinct enough to challenge the hops.

Intense clove flavors attack the palate, one side stays spicy, and the other shows a maltiness and sweetness. Some tropical fruitiness; strong, fresh apple and bubble-gum notes; and more biting phenols meet in the middle, like a train wreck. Peppery and bitey yeast, with an unpleasant pithy and tannic astringency. Smacks of lager-esque sourness, under a faint lemon. Some sweet malty flavors attempt to well up amid the chaos, but they get killed halfway through. Finishes dry, with a gummy character akin to Bazooka bubble gum, and lingering phenols.

Speaking of sweetness, ripe flavors of passion fruit, pineapple and candied cherries sneak in nicely. Then there&#39;s alcohol again. Oh sweet, sweet alcohol. A strong presence, warm and fumy as it vaporizes off the palate. Hop oils and raw, leafy hop tannins linger well beyond the finish, leaving a spicy, warm alcohol on the tongue and a drying malty biscuit character.

Served in a 16-ounce pint glass. Cloudy and dirty-peach-colored, topped with a thick, frothy, creamy foam head with great retention and stick, thanks to the hops. Spicy, floral hop aroma with sweetish pale malts beneath. Near full-bodied, incredibly smooth on the palate, creamy and silky. Sharpish citric snap up front, with notes of grapefruit, lime and lemon; deep floral notes as well. A tad resinous, a little piney, especially in the hop finish, which is puckering and drying. Sweet, bready malts with some fruitiness and a doughy yeast toward the end. Lingering hop spiciness and yeast in the finish. Very moreish and bone dry when the last sip fades away.

We sampled a few 12-ounce bottles of this cider, chilled down to 40 degrees. Light, fizzy bubbles rise to the top while pouring. Very pale yellow color. Low carbonation. At first glance, you might almost think this is a white wine. Smells of a blend of Pink Lady, Granny Smith and McIntosh apples; a bit buttery and musty in the back. Sulfites are very hard to detect. Very light body, very white-wine-ish. Tartness leads the way, soft but with a bite. Light, earthen notes; apple skin and apple pulp, middle to back. Sweet and sour apple flavor in the middle. Kiss of warmth from the alcohol. Wet and refreshing; almost too drinkable. At 6 percent alcohol by volume, any more than a few glasses will make you loopy.
